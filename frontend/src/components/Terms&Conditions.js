          <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            These Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) govern the relationship between EVRITECH (“We” or “The Company”), and the client (“You” or “Client”) engaging in web development and graphic design services.
            <br />
            EVRITECH handles web development projects, including but not limited to website creation and maintenance, as well as graphic design services.
            <br />
            By engaging with us for any services, you agree to these terms and conditions.
          </p>

          <h3>2. Services Provided</h3>
          <p>
            We provide web development and graphic design services, as agreed upon at the start of each project. Each project will include a clearly defined scope of work, deliverables, and deadlines.
          </p>

          <h3>3. Project Phases and Payment Terms</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>First 10% Free:</strong> The first 10% of the work is provided free of charge. This includes initial planning or templates, depending on the nature of the project.
            <br />
            <strong>10% Upfront Payment:</strong> After presenting the initial phase to the Client, a 10% payment is required to continue with the project. This phase is intended to ensure that the Client is satisfied with the direction and scope of the work.
            <br />
            <strong>Final Payment:</strong> Upon completion and delivery of the final product, the remaining balance will be due. Full payment will only be made after the Client has reviewed the final deliverables and as per the payment description & design concept.
            <br />
            <strong>Product Publishing:</strong> The product should be published within 24 hours after reception of the final payment.
            <br />
            All payments are non-refundable once the associated work has been completed and delivered.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Client Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure timely completion of the project, the Client is required to:
            <br />
            Provide necessary materials, and information promptly.
            <br />
            Offer timely feedback on designs, prototypes, or development phases as presented.
            <br />
            Confirm the scope and approve each phase of the project before further work continues.
          </p>

          <h3>5. EVRITECH Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            To ensure timely and successful completion of the project, EVRITECH agrees to:
            <br />
            <strong>Project Updates:</strong> Communicate timelines and milestones.
            <br />
            <strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Ensure work meets professional standards.
            <br />
            <strong>Support:</strong> Provide assistance during and post-project.
            <br />
            <strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Protect client information throughout.
            <br />
            <strong>Deliverables:</strong> Supply final files and documentation.
          </p>

          <h3>6. Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)</h3>
          <p>
            Upon full payment, the Client will hold the intellectual property rights to the final deliverables. However, EVRITECH retains the right to showcase the work for portfolio and marketing purposes unless otherwise agreed in writing.
            <br />
            Any pre-existing materials, such as stock images, fonts, or third-party software, will remain the intellectual property of their respective owners.
          </p>

          <h3>7. Revisions and Modifications</h3>
          <p>
            Each project includes one free minor revision. Any additional revisions or modifications beyond this first revision will incur an additional charge of a minimum equivalent of 50 US dollars (USD) per revision depending on the complexity of the revision. Requests for more than one revision will be handled through a new agreement or addendum, and the Client will be invoiced accordingly.
          </p>

          <h3>8. Security Disclaimer</h3>
          <p>
            We take all reasonable and industry-standard precautions to ensure the security of the websites and applications we develop, including implementing secure coding practices and basic protection against common vulnerabilities. However, due to the ever-evolving nature of the web environment, no system can be completely secure, and as such, we cannot guarantee absolute protection against all potential cyber threats or security breaches.
            <br />
            While we will take all necessary measures to secure the Client's website, we cannot accept responsibility for any loss, damage, or disruption caused by malicious attacks, hacking, or other security issues that arise post-delivery. The Client is advised to maintain ongoing security measures and monitoring systems to mitigate potential risks.
          </p>

          <h3>9. Limitation of Liability</h3>
          <p>
            Our liability for any claim, whether based on contract, tort, or otherwise, is limited to the total amount paid by the Client for the specific project in question. We will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data, or business interruptions.
          </p>

          <h3>10. DURATION OF AGREEMENT</h3>
          <p>
            This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and remain in effect until the completion of the project or as outlined in the project timeline, unless terminated earlier as per the terms of this Agreement. Any extensions or delays in the project timeline will be mutually agreed upon in writing by both parties.
          </p>

          <h3>11. Termination of Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            Either party may terminate this agreement at any time by giving written notice. In the event of termination by the Client, the Client is responsible for payment of any completed work up to the termination date, including a prorated amount for partially completed work.
            <br />
            EVRITECH is entitled to terminate the Agreement in cases of Client non-compliance, including failure to provide the initial 10% payment after the corresponding work is completed. In such an event, the Client remains responsible for settling the payment due for this portion of work.
          </p>

          <h3>12. Portfolio and Marketing Rights</h3>
          <p>
            We reserve the right to display and showcase any completed work in our portfolio and marketing materials unless a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is in place that prevents this.
          </p>

          <h3>13. Third-Party Services and Integration</h3>
          <p>
            We may use or recommend third-party services, plugins, or applications (e.g., hosting platforms, content management systems, or design tools) as part of the project. We are not responsible for the performance, security, or reliability of third-party services. The Client acknowledges that use of such services is at their own risk.
          </p>

          <h3>14. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>
            This agreement is governed by the laws of British Columbia, Canada. Any disputes arising under this agreement shall be resolved in the jurisdiction of British Columbia, unless mutually agreed otherwise.
          </p>

          <h3>15. Force Majeure</h3>
          <p>
            We are not liable for any delay or failure to perform our obligations under this agreement due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, war, labor disputes, or internet or hosting outages.
          </p>

          <h3>16. Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>
            This document represents the entire agreement between the Client and EVRITECH, superseding any prior agreements, discussions, or negotiations. Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.
          </p>

          <h3>17. Severability</h3>
          <p>
            If any part of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.
          </p>
